### Hi, I'm Alex ðŸ‘‹. I'm a data scientist with a passion for analyzing complex problems to make them clear, comprehensible, and actionable. I'm looking for opportunities to use my skills!

I work with SQL and Python, especially in Pandas, sklearn, TensorFlow, and Flask to develop and deploy solutions.

When I'm not programming, I love to read and play soccer.
